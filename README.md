# Pembayaran Listrik (Electricity Payment)

CRUD system for study case Electricity Payment. Didn't contain an actual payment process or other payment using a third party (Payment Gateway). This project contains nodejs material from routing using express, database manipulation using sequelize as ORM,  and basic authorization and authentication using JSON web token library. 
## Environment Variables

This project didn't implement environment variables, cuz all the SECRET KEY already hardcoded in each file (usually at the top of the file)


## Deployment

Package manager already updated using pnpm. First install the dependencies using the command.

```bash
  pnpm install
```

Now you can run this with command

```bash
  pnpm start
```

PS: Watch out! There is nodemon in this programme
